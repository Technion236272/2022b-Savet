# Savet

> Savet is an app that combines saved collections from multiple social media platforms into one place.

## Motivation

Lately, we've been surrounded by many social media apps, and with that many interesting posts, each app does offer to save these posts under a pinned category to make it possible to find these posts again, but having multiple social media accounts makes it difficult to remember on which platform was each post saved. And that's where 'Savet' comes, an app that saves each of your favorite content into categories.
